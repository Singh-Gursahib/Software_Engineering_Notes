## Topics Covered

- Evolution processes
- Legacy systems
- Software maintenance

## Software Change

- Software change is inevitable
    - New requirements emerge when the software is used;
    - The business environment changes;
    - Errors must be repaired;
    - New computers and equipment is added to the system;
    - The performance or reliability of the system may have to be improved.
- A key problem for all organizations is implementing and managing change to their existing software systems.

## Importance of Evolution

- Organisations have huge investments in their software systems—they are critical business assets.
- To maintain the value of these assets to the business, they must be changed and updated.
- The majority of the software budget in large companies is devoted to changing and evolving existing software rather than developing new software.

## A Spiral Model of Development and Evolution

# Evolution and Servicing

Evolution is the stage in a software system's life cycle where it is in operational use and is evolving as new requirements are proposed and implemented in the system.

### Servicing

At this stage, the software remains useful but the only changes made are those required to keep it operational, i.e., bug fixes and changes to reflect changes in the software's environment. No new functionality is added.

### Phase-out

The software may still be used but no further changes are made to it.

# Evolution Processes

Software evolution processes depend on:

- The type of software being maintained
- The development processes used
- The skills and experience of the people involved

Proposals for change are the driver for system evolution. They should be linked with components that are affected by the change, thus allowing the cost and impact of the change to be estimated.

Change identification and evolution continues throughout the system lifetime.

# Change Implementation

Change implementation is the iteration of the development process where revisions to the system are designed, implemented, and tested. A critical difference is that the first stage of change implementation may involve program understanding, especially if the original system developers are not responsible for the change implementation.

During the program understanding phase, you have to understand how the program is structured, how it delivers functionality, and how the proposed change might affect the program.

# Urgent Change Requests

Urgent changes may have to be implemented without going through all stages of the software engineering process.

- If a serious system fault has to be repaired to allow normal operation to continue;
- If changes to the system's environment (e.g., an OS upgrade) have unexpected effects;
- If there are business changes that require a very rapid response (e.g., the release of a competing product).

# Agile Methods and Evolution

Agile methods are based on incremental development, so the transition from development to evolution is a seamless one. Evolution is simply a continuation of the development process based on frequent system releases.

Automated regression testing is particularly valuable when changes are made to a system. Changes may be expressed as additional user stories.

# Handover Problems

- Where the development team have used an agile approach but the evolution team is unfamiliar with agile methods and prefer a plan-based approach. The evolution team may expect detailed documentation to support evolution, and this is not produced in agile processes.
- Where a plan-based approach has been used for development but the evolution team prefer to use agile methods. The evolution team may have to start from scratch developing automated tests, and the code in the system may not have been refactored and simplified as is expected in agile development.

# Legacy Systems

Legacy systems are older systems that rely on languages and technology that are no longer used for new systems development. Legacy software may be dependent on older hardware, such as mainframe computers, and may have associated legacy processes and procedures.

Legacy systems are not just software systems but are broader socio-technical systems that include hardware, software, libraries, and other supporting software and business processes.

# Legacy System Components

- **System hardware**: Written for hardware that is no longer available
- **Support software**: Range of support software that may be obsolete or unsupported
- **Application software**: Made up of a number of application programs
- **Application data**: Data processed by the application system, may be inconsistent, duplicated, or held in different databases

# Legacy System Components

- **Business processes**: Processes used in the business to achieve some business objective
    - Business processes may be designed around a legacy system and constrained by the functionality that it provides
- **Business policies and rules**: Definitions of how the business should be carried out and constraints on the business; use of the legacy application system may be embedded in these policies and rules

# Legacy System Layers

# Legacy System Replacement

- Legacy system replacement is risky and expensive, so businesses continue to use these systems.
- System replacement is risky for a number of reasons:
    - Lack of complete system specification
    - Tight integration of system and business processes
    - Undocumented business rules embedded in the legacy system
    - New software development may be late and/or over budget

# Legacy System Change

- Legacy systems are expensive to change for a number of reasons:
    - No consistent programming style
    - Use of obsolete programming languages with few people available with these language skills
    - Inadequate system documentation
    - System structure degradation
    - Program optimizations may make them hard to understand
    - Data errors, duplication, and inconsistency

**Legacy system management**

Organisations that rely on legacy systems must choose a strategy for evolving these systems:

- Scrap the system completely and modify business processes so that it is no longer required;
- Continue maintaining the system;
- Transform the system by re-engineering to improve its maintainability;
- Replace the system with a new system.

The strategy chosen should depend on the system quality and its business value.

**Legacy system categories**

- **Low quality, low business value**: These systems should be scrapped.
- **Low-quality, high-business value**: These make an important business contribution but are expensive to maintain. Should be re-engineered or replaced if a suitable system is available.
- **High-quality, low-business value**: Replace with COTS, scrap completely, or maintain.
- **High-quality, high business value**: Continue in operation using normal system maintenance.

**Business value assessment**

Assessment should take different viewpoints into account:

- System end-users;
- Business customers;
- Line managers;
- IT managers;
- Senior managers.

Interview different stakeholders and collate results.

**Issues in business value assessment**

- **The use of the system**: If systems are only used occasionally or by a small number of people, they may have a low business value.
- **The business processes that are supported**: A system may have a low business value if it forces the use of inefficient business processes.
- **System dependability**: If a system is not dependable and the problems directly affect business customers, the system has a low business value.
- **The system outputs**: If the business depends on system outputs, then the system has a high business value.

### System Quality Assessment

### Business Process Assessment

- How well does the business process support the current goals of the business?
- Use a viewpoint-oriented approach and seek answers from system stakeholders:
    - Is there a defined process model and is it followed?
    - Do different parts of the organisation use different processes for the same function?
    - How has the process been adapted?
    - What are the relationships with other business processes and are these necessary?
    - Is the process effectively supported by the legacy application software?

### Example

- A travel ordering system may have a low business value because of the widespread use of web-based ordering.

### Environment Assessment

Factors:

- **Supplier stability**: Is the supplier still in existence? Is the supplier financially stable and likely to continue in existence? If the supplier is no longer in business, does someone else maintain the systems?
- **Failure rate**: Does the hardware have a high rate of reported failures? Does the support software crash and force system restarts?
- **Age**: How old is the hardware and software? The older the hardware and support software, the more obsolete it will be. It may still function correctly but there could be significant economic and business benefits to moving to a more modern system.
- **Performance**: Is the performance of the system adequate? Do performance problems have a significant effect on system users?

### Factors Used in Environment Assessment

- **Support requirements**: What local support is required by the hardware and software? If there are high costs associated with this support, it may be worth considering system replacement.
- **Maintenance costs**: What are the costs of hardware maintenance and support software licences? Older hardware may have higher maintenance costs than modern systems. Support software may have high annual licensing costs.
- **Interoperability**: Are there problems interfacing the system to other systems? Can compilers, for example, be used with current versions of the operating system? Is hardware emulation required?

### Application Assessment

Factors:

- **Understandability**: How difficult is it to understand the source code of the current system? How complex are the control structures that are used? Do variables have meaningful names that reflect their function?
- **Documentation**: What system documentation is available? Is the documentation complete, consistent, and current?
- **Data**: Is there an explicit data model for the system? To what extent is data duplicated across files? Is the data used by the system up to date and consistent?
- **Performance**: Is the performance of the application adequate? Do performance problems have a significant effect on system users?

### Factors Used in Application Assessment

| **Factor** | **Questions** |
| --- | --- |
| **Programming Language** | Are modern compilers available for the programming language used to develop the system?Is the programming language still used for new system development? |
| **Configuration Management** | Are all versions of all parts of the system managed by a configuration management system?Is there an explicit description of the versions of components that are used in the current system? |
| **Test Data** | Does test data for the system exist?Is there a record of regression tests carried out when new features have been added to the system? |
| **Personnel Skills** | Are there people available who have the skills to maintain the application?Are there people available who have experience with the system? |

### System Measurement

- Collect quantitative data to make an assessment of the quality of the application system.
- **Quality factors**:
    - The number of system change requests; the higher this accumulated value, the lower the quality of the system.
    - The number of different user interfaces used by the system; the more interfaces, the more likely it is that there will be inconsistencies and redundancies in these interfaces.
    - The volume of data used by the system; as the volume of data (number of files, size of database, etc.) processed by the system increases, so too do the inconsistencies and errors in that data.
    - Cleaning up old data is a very expensive and time-consuming process.

## Maintenance Effort Distribution

Maintenance effort distribution is affected by both technical and non-technical factors.

### Maintenance Costs

- Usually greater than development costs (2× to 100× depending on the application).
- Increases as software is maintained.
- Maintenance corrupts the software structure, making further maintenance more difficult.

### Ageing Software

- Ageing software can have high support costs (e.g., old languages, compilers, etc.).

### Maintenance and New Features

- It is usually more expensive to add new features to a system during maintenance than it is to add the same features during development.

### Challenges in Maintenance

- A new team has to understand the programs being maintained.
- Separating maintenance and development means there is no incentive for the development team to write maintainable software.
- Program maintenance work is unpopular.
- Maintenance staff are often inexperienced and have limited domain knowledge.
- As programs age, their structure degrades and they become harder to change.

## Maintenance Prediction

Maintenance prediction is concerned with assessing which parts of the system may cause problems and have high maintenance costs.

### Factors Affecting Maintenance Costs

- Change acceptance depends on the maintainability of the components affected by the change.
- Implementing changes degrades the system and reduces its maintainability.
- Maintenance costs depend on the number of changes, and costs of change depend on maintainability.

Predicting the number of changes requires understanding relationships between a system and its environment. Tightly coupled systems require changes whenever the environment is changed. Factors influencing this relationship include:

- Number and complexity of system interfaces;
- Number of inherently volatile system requirements;
- The business processes where the system is used.

Predictions of maintainability can be made by assessing the complexity of system components. Studies have shown that most maintenance effort is spent on a relatively small number of system components. Complexity depends on:

- Complexity of control structures;
- Complexity of data structures;
- Object, method (procedure), and module size.

Process metrics may be used to assess maintainability:

- Number of requests for corrective maintenance;
- Average time required for impact analysis;
- Average time taken to implement a change request;
- Number of outstanding change requests.

If any or all of these is increasing, this may indicate a decline in maintainability.

Software reengineering involves restructuring or rewriting part or all of a legacy system without changing its functionality. It is applicable where some but not all sub-systems of a larger system require frequent maintenance. Reengineering involves adding effort to make them easier to maintain. The system may be restructured and re-documented.

Advantages of reengineering include:

- **Reduced risk**: There is a high risk in new software development. There may be development problems, staffing problems, and specification problems.
- **Reduced cost**: The cost of re-engineering is often significantly less than the costs of developing new software.

# Reengineering Process

**Reengineering process activities**

- **Source code translation**
    - Convert code to a new language.
- **Reverse engineering**
    - Analyze the program to understand it.
- **Program structure improvement**
    - Restructure automatically for understandability.
- **Program modularization**
    - Reorganize the program structure.
- **Data reengineering**
    - Clean up and restructure system data.

# Reengineering Approaches

# Reengineering Cost Factors

- The quality of the software to be reengineered.
- The tool support available for reengineering.
- The extent of the data conversion which is required.
- The availability of expert staff for reengineering.
    - This can be a problem with old systems based on technology that is no longer widely used.

# Refactoring

Refactoring is the process of making improvements to a program to slow down degradation through change.

You can think of refactoring as ‘preventative maintenance’ that reduces the problems of future change.

Refactoring involves modifying a program to improve its structure, reduce its complexity, or make it easier to understand.

When you refactor a program, you should not add functionality but rather concentrate on program improvement.

# Refactoring and Reengineering

- **Re-engineering** takes place after a system has been maintained for some time and maintenance costs are increasing. You use automated tools to process and re-engineer a legacy system to create a new system that is more maintainable.
- **Refactoring** is a continuous process of improvement throughout the development and evolution process. It is intended to avoid the structure and code degradation that increases the costs and difficulties of maintaining a system.

# 'Bad Smells' in Program Code

### Duplicate Code

- The same or very similar code may be included at different places in a program. This can be removed and implemented as a single method or function that is called as required.

### Long Methods

- If a method is too long, it should be redesigned as a number of shorter methods.

### Switch (case) Statements

- These often involve duplication, where the switch depends on the type of a value. The switch statements may be scattered around a program. In object-oriented languages, you can often use polymorphism to achieve the same thing.

# 'Bad Smells' in Program Code

### Data Clumping

- Data clumps occur when the same group of data items (fields in classes, parameters in methods) reoccur in several places in a program. These can often be replaced with an object that encapsulates all of the data.

### Speculative Generality

- This occurs when developers include generality in a program in case it is required in the future. This can often simply be removed.

# Key Points

- Software development and evolution can be thought of as an integrated, iterative process that can be represented using a spiral model.
- For custom systems, the costs of software maintenance usually exceed the software development costs.
- The process of software evolution is driven by requests for changes and includes change impact analysis, release planning, and change implementation.
- Legacy systems are older software systems, developed using obsolete software and hardware technologies, that remain useful for a business.
- It is often cheaper and less risky to maintain a legacy system than to develop a replacement system using modern technology.
- The business value of a legacy system and the quality of the application should be assessed to help decide if a system should be replaced, transformed, or maintained.
- There are 3 types of software maintenance, namely bug fixing, modifying software to work in a new environment, and implementing new or changed requirements.

**Software re-engineering** is concerned with re-structuring and re-documenting software to make it easier to understand and change.

**Refactoring**, making program changes that preserve functionality, is a form of preventative maintenance.
